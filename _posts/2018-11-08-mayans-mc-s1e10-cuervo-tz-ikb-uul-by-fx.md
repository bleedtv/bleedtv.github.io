<p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><strong>BleedTV</strong> covers <em>Mayans M.C.</em> Season 1- Episode 10, "Cuervo/Tz'ikb'uul". Potter got a change and it suits him well! Can't wait to see what his plus one is gonna stir up.  Alarvez and Galindo are going to rustle a lot of feathers hopefully this move doesn't come back to bite them.  EZ and Angel are going to have a lot to sort through, or have we already smoothed that over with the big reveal? Listen in as we breakdown this fantastic season finale!  #ElJefe</span></p>
