Zack, Jake, and Cash break down True Detectives Season 3 Episode 7 "The Final Country". We got a brand new timeline this episode and confirmation that Rebecca did at least grow up. The possible wedge that caused strife between Roland and Hays. We finally got to see Hoyt flex some of the power that we knew he had. We have the theories and more on this breakdown heading into the season finale!
