<p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><strong>BleedTV</strong> covers <em>The Walking Dead Season 9 Episode 8 "Evolution"</em> - The Mid-Season Finale is upon us and it leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  The Whisperers are here and they are as vicious as we could have hoped! Are they what the gang needs to bury the hatchet (whatever that could be), and finally come back together as one? Hopefully we find out!</span></p>
