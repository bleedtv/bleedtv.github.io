<p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><strong>BleedTV</strong> Zack, Jake, and Cash break down True Detectives Season 3 Episode 4 "The Hour and the Day" the only way we know how! Some of the best writing the show has seen appears in this episode! If you didn't know already you know now why these actors were chosen, as Hays (Ali) and West (Dorff) put on a clinic. We meet a few characters and have some brought back to us, which we believe are all red herrings. The evidence is just a little too in your face for us to believe we have met our actual villain yet. Play along with us as we gauge the temp on our villain meter?</span></p>
