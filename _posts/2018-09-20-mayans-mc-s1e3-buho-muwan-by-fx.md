<p><strong>BleedTV</strong> covers <em>Mayans M.C.</em> Season 1- Episode 3, "Buho/Muwan". Probably the strongest episode yet.  We got a lot of character development that explains the actions that we have been seeing, which we LOVE! Bishop and Galindo are flexing their muscle now and showing why they are in their positions.  Let us know what you think about them and where you see them at the end of the season.  How about some of the big power moves made in the episode?!!!</p>
