<p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><strong>BleedTV</strong>Â Zack, Jake, and Cash break down True Detectives Season 3 Episode 5 "If You Have Ghosts". The Super Bowl gave us the best gift ever by getting HBO to drop this gem early! By far the best episode thus far, and probably the season. Pizzalto shows what he can do behind the camera with some amazing shots, fantastic pacing, and allowing the actors to act. Great job by the whole crew for knociking it out the park!!! Everything that was led up in last weeks "filler" episode gets answered here. There is a lot to breakdown and we do it all. Theories are abound so make sure you let us know your thoughts!!!</span></p>
