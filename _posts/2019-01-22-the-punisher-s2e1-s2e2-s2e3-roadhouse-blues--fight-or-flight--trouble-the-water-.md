<p><strong>BleedTV</strong> Zack, Jake, and Cash dive into streaming services with the ultra violent and brilliantly acted <em>The Punisher</em>. Picking up where we left off last season Frank Castle (Jon Berthenal) is trying to move on with his life and see where the world takes him. That happens to be BFE Michigan, where he runs into a young woman (Giorgia Whigham) who has gotten in over her head. Frank does everything he can to help, but ultimately gets himself into too much trouble. His horseshoe hasn't dried up yet since Agent Madani (Amber Rose Revah) still needs his help taking down Billy Russo (Ben Barnes) after he escapes. Join us as we rant and rave about the fighting, stunts, action, pacing, and so much more.</p>
